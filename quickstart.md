# Data Science Case Study: Supplier Audit Results Prediction

The case study is done with [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [Quarto Notebooks](https://quarto.org).
For the data-wrangling and cleaning [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org) was used and for machine
learning the [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.2/) library was used with the
[mlr3](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com) library as the interface.

The notebook can the found in the `notebook/` folder with the rendered HTML file.

## Installation

The project uses [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for package management.
Call `renv::init()` to restore the project and install project dependencies.
